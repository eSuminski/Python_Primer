general flow to follow:

git clone {repo link}

git checkout -b "branchname" (this creates a new branch and changes to it)

git add . (when you are ready to add your work to the repo. This puts your work into "staging")

git commit -m "your message here" (this actually saves your work)

git push (if you are making changes to a branch this is fine)
git push --set-upstream origin currentbranch (use this if you want to push changes from your branch to the main branch)

if your .gitignore file is not properly preventing files and folders from being saved on the repo then clone your
repo again, checkout a branch, and run the following command before the add . command:
git rm -r --cached .
